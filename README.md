<h2>Personal Description:</h2>
<p>"I think that I view myself as a futuristic-space-knight, although I've only fought a few Lazer-Dragons. I am currently saving up to buy a starship/time machine I found on ebay. I am single, and would like to keep it that way, as all zucchinis carry the pineapple death. I am also looking to relocate to venus, as the cost of living is <em>much</em> lower than here on earth, considering that the alien economy is doing <em>very</em> badly, and earth money is worth a lot more there. but right now i'm <em>really</em> struggling.
Yup.
<em>Really</em>.
You see, I just can't seem to build up the courage to go see this <strong>really</strong> scary movie called YouTube. You've probably never heard of it. It's the sequel to a movie that failed really bad called Google. But it's <em>super</em> scary. It's about this guy called DanTDM who's hair is so bad, it will give you nightmares for days. Well, that's pretty much me. If you're interested in using my programming or lazer-dragon slaying services, here's the number: 605-475-6968."</p>
